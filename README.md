## ⚠️ Legal Warning

This program is a **destructive system utility** designed to irreversibly damage Windows-based operating systems.  
It performs low-level operations such as boot sector corruption, registry deletion, file encryption, and forced system reboots.

This project is provided **strictly for local experimental use** within isolated test environments.  
**Running this tool on any system you do not fully own and control is illegal and unethical.**  
The author holds **no responsibility or liability** for any damage caused.

## What SystemAnnihilator Does

- Elevates the process to critical system-level privileges.
- Overwrites the Master Boot Record (MBR), breaking system startup.
- Corrupts or removes core operating system files and directories.
- Wipes essential Windows registry hives (e.g., SAM, SYSTEM).
- Encrypts system and user files using AES-256 encryption.
- Overwrites unallocated disk space to prevent file recovery.
- Displays a final on-screen warning before execution.
- Forces an immediate reboot after completing all operations.

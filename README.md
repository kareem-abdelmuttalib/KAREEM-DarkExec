## ⚠️ Legal Warning

This program is a **destructive system utility** designed to irreversibly damage Windows-based operating systems.  
It executes destructive actions at the system level, such as overwriting the boot sector, deleting critical registry hives, encrypting files, and initiating an immediate forced reboot.

This project is provided **strictly for local experimental use** within isolated test environments.  
**Running this tool on any system you do not fully own and control is illegal and unethical.**  
The author holds **no responsibility or liability** for any damage caused.

## What SystemAnnihilator Does

- Elevates the process to critical system-level privileges.
- Overwrites the Master Boot Record (MBR), breaking system startup.
- Corrupts or removes core operating system files and directories.
- Wipes essential Windows registry hives (e.g., SAM, SYSTEM).
- Encrypts system and user files using AES-256 encryption.
- Overwrites unallocated disk space to prevent file recovery.
- Displays a final on-screen warning before execution.
- Forces an immediate reboot after completing all operations.
